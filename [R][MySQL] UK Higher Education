As an incoming postgraduate student at the UK university,  I have often visited HESA, the Higher Education Statistics Agency, to attain useful information.
HESA offers excellent graphs from various angles in detail so that I don't need to visualize raw data. 
However, I found the dataset which is appropriate to practice the reshape2 package.
Below are my R and MySQL code.

-----

uk_he <- read.csv("figure-4.csv", skip=17)  # Add 'check.names=FALSE' if you want to remove the period
str(uk_he)

names(uk_he) <- tolower(names(uk_he))
head(uk_he)
table(is.na(uk_he))


library(reshape2)
melt_uk_he <- melt(uk_he,id.vars=c("category marker","category"), measure.var="level of study")
